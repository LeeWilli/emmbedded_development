1. Make "hw5" directory and create python files named hw5_1.py and hw5_2.py, hw5_3.py ... in it if more than one problem are provided.

    Now we will learn how to turn an LED on/off using a push button, 
which is used as a GPIO input from Raspberry Pi GPIO. A push button connection is diaplayed in the following figure:

Our hardware wiring is simple. You simply connect the LED to GPIO23 from 
Raspberry Pi. The push button is connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO on GPIO24. 
The complete hardware wiring can be seen in the following figure:

Furthermore, you can write a Python program to read the push button's state. If you 
press the push button, the program will turn on the LED. Otherwise, it will turn off 
the LED.
