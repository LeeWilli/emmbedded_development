1. 在自己账户目录下创建子目录hw3，所有要检查的文件都放在这个目录下，文件名字以hw3_1,hw3_2开头，hw3后面的数字表示题号。
2. problems
    1. Write a Python to allow users input a number, and decide whether the number is even or odd, and print your results on the terminal.
    2. read the following python, which is a number-guessing game. Note that this program will throw an error if you enter text that isn’t a number. you need to fix it through using a try statement to catch it.
```
import random
secret = int(random.uniform(0,10))
print("I'm thinking of a number between zero and ten."
 , "Can you guess what it is?")
guess = 11

while guess != secret:
    guess = int(input("Take a guess: "))
print("Well done!")
```
a try statement way is
```
try:
 code where there might be a problem
except type_of_error:
 code to run if there's an error
``` 
3. read the following python and please be ready to explain it for us in the next class.  The example's objective is to create a simple database of student
results at a college. It’ll load some default data, and allow you to edit it
    
```
