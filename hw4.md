    1. If a circuit is connected like Figure 5-1 on page 167 for our textbook, you need to program to implement brightness-level control through PWM. This is achieved by flashing 
  the LED faster than can be perceived by a human, where the amount of time that the LED remains on, versus off(i.e., the duty cycle) affects 
  the human-perceived bright-ness level. You need to provide a menu for users' selection as Listing 5-3 did on page 174. With setup command, the delay_on time and the delay_off     time need to be set. The delay_on time is used for the time of LED'brightness remaining high, while the delay_off time is used for the time of LED'brightness remaining low.
